Thoughts on F# workshop:

- Keeping to time is important, have check points
- Give a few canoncial examples of ADTs rather than audience?
- Bring people pack together at the start of each section
- Adopt TDD style for valuing pot?
- Use GitHub links to guide people
- Prepare handout or cheat sheet
- Ask 'why are you here' in intro
