Build yourself a Robo-Advisor in F#
===

Code and resources for the 'Build yourself a Robo-Advisor in F#' workshop, as presented at the 2016 F# Progressive Tutorials conference in London.

## Abstract

Most of us aren't saving enough for our future. This isn't something that's going to go away - we're living longer and many of us are underestimating how much money we need for a comfortable retirement. How can you solve this problem? By harnessing the power of F# to deliver clear and easy-to-understand advice and recommendations that takes you on a journey from confused to confident.

Over the last couple of years, robo-advisors have emerged as a platform for automating this advice as one part of the Fintech revolution. By the time you have completed this workshop, you will have built a fully functioning web-based robo advisor that will tell you if you're on track to hit your savings goals, and give you recommendations if you aren't quite there yet.

In this progressive workshop, you will discover the following:

- Understand the domain and model it with some help from F#'s Algebraic Data Types.
- Leverage F#'s data capabilities and make a first program that can chart our projected savings.
- Take it to the next level by building a web-based robo-advisor using one of F#'s fantastic open-source web app frameworks.
